Start off with a simple repl that has the three features, initially with dummy data then persisted as json? to file system.
Test as necessary, for example that only a transaction that balances to 0 can be created.
Improve interactivity using some kind of curses library (purescript-blessed?)

Use purescript-node-readline for repl, with purescript-optparse to parse commands if needed

Use Int for account ids for now for easy selection (ðŸ˜…). Should use proper id and allow choosing an account by name
Only supporting transactions in one currency ($) currently.
UUID would be good for transaction id. Work out how to use that later.
Amount in cents, probably use newtype to enforce this or something.

Account balances calculated from transaction list on load? One source of truth + fine for now
Is there a better way than nested map updates?

Not sure if initAccounts behaviour is correct. purescript-spec?
Then add command handling.
Transactions should support multiple inputs and outputs?

Using `purty`. Formatting is a bit weird sometimes.

Unclear what formatter/printf to use to specify digits after decimal place. `purescript-formatting` looks like it will add leading 0s.
