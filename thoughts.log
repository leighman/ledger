Start off with a simple repl that has the three features, initially with dummy data then persisted as json? to file system.
Test as necessary, for example that only a transaction that balances to 0 can be created.
Improve interactivity using some kind of curses library (purescript-blessed?)

Use purescript-node-readline for repl, with purescript-optparse to parse commands if needed
